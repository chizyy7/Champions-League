Welcome to the **Champions League** repository! This project is dedicated to developing a machine learning model that predicts the winner of the UEFA Champions League.

## 🚀 Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning techniques to analyze data and predict the winner of the celebrated Champions League tournament.
- **Data Analysis**: Preprocess and analyze historical match data.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Easily extend the model for other predictive sports tournaments.

## 🧠 Technologies

- **Programming Language**: [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- **Machine Learning Tools**: Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. (Details on specific libraries will be documented once dependencies are finalized.)

## 📂 Structure

- `data/`: Placeholder for dataset files.
- `src/`: Core scripts for modeling and data pre-processing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model experiments.
- `outputs/`: Model performance results and predictions.
- `README.md`: Repository information and usage guidelines.

*(Note: Specific folder/file organization is flexible and will evolve as the project progresses.)*

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chizyy7/Champions-League.git
   cd Champions-League
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

*(Dependency management to be completed.)*

## 🕹️ Usage

To use this project:

1. Load your Champions League dataset into the `data/` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing and training scripts from the `src/` directory:
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```
3. Review predictions and evaluation metrics output in the `outputs/` directory.

(Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder are recommended for experimenting with datasets and analyzing model performance.)
